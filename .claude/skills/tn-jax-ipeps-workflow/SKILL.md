# iPEPS Workflow — 2D Ground States and Excitations with Tenax

This skill guides students through infinite Projected Entangled Pair State
(iPEPS) calculations using Tenax. iPEPS is the natural tensor network ansatz
for 2D quantum systems in the thermodynamic limit.

## When to Use iPEPS vs Cylinder DMRG

| | Cylinder DMRG | iPEPS |
|---|---|---|
| **Geometry** | Finite cylinder (open x, periodic y) | Infinite 2D plane |
| **Finite-size effects** | Yes (finite Lx and Ly) | No (infinite, but finite D) |
| **Best for** | Quasi-1D, moderate Ly | Truly 2D, ordered phases |
| **Main parameter** | Bond dim χ (MPS) | Bond dim D (PEPS) + χ (CTM) |
| **Tenax function** | `dmrg()` with cylinder MPO | `ipeps()` or `optimize_gs_ad()` |

Rule of thumb: if the system has clear 2D order (Néel, VBS) or you want the
thermodynamic limit directly, use iPEPS. If you need high accuracy for finite
systems or entanglement entropy, use cylinder DMRG.

## Stage 1: Define the Model and Build the Gate

iPEPS works with nearest-neighbor gates (two-site operators), not MPOs.

### Building a gate

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Spin-1/2 operators
Sz = 0.5 * jnp.array([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, -1.0]])
Sp = jnp.array([[0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0]])
Sm = jnp.array([[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]])

# Heisenberg gate: h = Sz⊗Sz + (1/2)(S+⊗S- + S-⊗S+)
gate = jnp.einsum("ij,kl->ikjl", Sz, Sz) \
     + 0.5 * (jnp.einsum("ij,kl->ikjl", Sp, Sm)
             + jnp.einsum("ij,kl->ikjl", Sm, Sp))
```

The gate has shape `(d, d, d, d)` = `(2, 2, 2, 2)` for spin-1/2. The indices
are `(ket_i, ket_j, bra_i, bra_j)`.

### Physics checkpoint

Ask the student: "Is this a frustrated model? Does the ground state break a
symmetry (e.g., Néel order for Heisenberg)? This determines the unit cell size."

---

## Stage 2: Simple Update (Imaginary Time Evolution)

The simple update is the fastest way to get an initial iPEPS. It applies
imaginary time evolution gates e^{-δτ h} to evolve toward the ground state,
using a Trotter decomposition.

### 1-site unit cell

```python
from tenax import iPEPSConfig, CTMConfig, ipeps

config = iPEPSConfig(
    max_bond_dim=2,              # iPEPS bond dimension D
    num_imaginary_steps=200,     # Number of Trotter steps
    dt=0.3,                      # Imaginary time step δτ
    ctm=CTMConfig(chi=10, max_iter=40),  # CTM environment params
    unit_cell="1x1",             # Translationally invariant
)
energy, peps, envs = ipeps(gate, None, config)
print(f"Energy per site: {energy:.6f}")
```

### 2-site unit cell (checkerboard)

For states with broken translational symmetry (e.g., Néel order):

```python
config = iPEPSConfig(
    max_bond_dim=2,
    num_imaginary_steps=200,
    dt=0.3,
    ctm=CTMConfig(chi=10, max_iter=40),
    unit_cell="2site",           # A-B checkerboard
)
energy, peps, (env_A, env_B) = ipeps(gate, None, config)
print(f"Energy per site: {energy:.6f}")  # ≈ -0.65 for Heisenberg
```

### Key parameters

| Parameter | Role | Guidance |
|-----------|------|----------|
| `max_bond_dim` (D) | iPEPS expressiveness | Start D=2, increase to 3,4,5 |
| `dt` | Trotter time step | Start 0.3, reduce to 0.1, 0.01 for accuracy |
| `num_imaginary_steps` | Evolution length | 200–500; increase if not converged |
| `ctm.chi` | CTM environment bond dim | χ ≥ D² for accuracy; start 10–20 |
| `ctm.max_iter` | CTM convergence iterations | 40–100 |
| `unit_cell` | Translational symmetry | "1x1" or "2site" |

### What to watch for

- **Energy not decreasing** → δτ too large (Trotter error dominates). Reduce dt.
- **Energy oscillating** → try a 2-site unit cell if using 1-site (maybe the
  ground state breaks translational symmetry).
- **Energy converged but too high** → D too small, or CTM χ too small.

## Stage 3: AD-Based Ground-State Optimization

The simple update gives a good initial state but is approximate (it ignores
the environment during updates). For higher accuracy, use automatic
differentiation (AD) to variationally optimize the iPEPS tensors directly.

Tenax implements the method of Francuz et al. (PRR 7, 013237): gradient
optimization via implicit differentiation through the CTM fixed point.

```python
from tenax import iPEPSConfig, CTMConfig, optimize_gs_ad

config = iPEPSConfig(
    max_bond_dim=2,
    ctm=CTMConfig(chi=16, max_iter=50),  # Higher χ for AD
    gs_num_steps=200,                     # Optimization steps
    gs_learning_rate=1e-3,                # Adam learning rate
)

# Can start from scratch or from simple-update result
A_opt, env, E_gs = optimize_gs_ad(gate, None, config)
print(f"Ground-state energy: {E_gs:.6f}")
```

### Key differences from simple update

- **More accurate** — optimizes the full variational energy, not a local
  approximation.
- **Slower** — each step requires CTM convergence + backward pass through it.
- **Sensitive to initialization** — starting from a simple-update result
  helps avoid bad local minima.
- **Learning rate matters** — if loss oscillates, reduce `gs_learning_rate`.
  If convergence is too slow, increase it.

### Physics insight

Explain to students: "The simple update is like a mean-field approximation
for the environment — each bond is updated independently. The AD optimization
treats the full 2D environment exactly (up to CTM truncation), which is why
it's more accurate but more expensive. This is analogous to going from
Hartree-Fock to a correlated method in quantum chemistry."

## Stage 4: Quasiparticle Excitations

Once you have an optimized ground state, Tenax can compute quasiparticle
excitation spectra at arbitrary Brillouin zone momenta, following
Ponsioen et al. (SciPost Phys. 12, 006, 2022).

```python
from tenax import ExcitationConfig, compute_excitations, make_momentum_path

# Define a path through the Brillouin zone
momenta = make_momentum_path("brillouin", num_points=20)

# Compute excitation energies
exc_config = ExcitationConfig(num_excitations=3, chi=16)
result = compute_excitations(A_opt, env, gate, E_gs, momenta, exc_config)

print(result.energies.shape)  # (num_momenta, num_excitations) = (20, 3)
```

### Interpreting results

- **Gapped spectrum** → the lowest excitation energy is > 0 everywhere in
  the BZ. Indicates a gapped phase (e.g., valence bond solid).
- **Gapless at specific k-points** → indicates spontaneous symmetry breaking
  (Goldstone modes) or a critical point.
- **For the Heisenberg antiferromagnet** → expect gapless magnon excitations
  at k = (π, π) (the antiferromagnetic wavevector).

### Plotting the dispersion

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
for n in range(result.energies.shape[1]):
    ax.plot(result.energies[:, n], label=f"Band {n}")
ax.set_xlabel("Momentum path index")
ax.set_ylabel("Excitation energy")
ax.legend()
plt.savefig("dispersion.png")
```

## Stage 5: Convergence Studies

Guide students through systematic convergence checks:

### D-scaling (iPEPS bond dimension)

```python
for D in [2, 3, 4, 5]:
    config = iPEPSConfig(
        max_bond_dim=D,
        ctm=CTMConfig(chi=D**2 + 4, max_iter=60),
        gs_num_steps=300,
        gs_learning_rate=1e-3,
    )
    A, env, E = optimize_gs_ad(gate, None, config)
    print(f"D={D}: E/site = {E:.8f}")
```

Rule of thumb: CTM χ should be at least D² for reliable results.

### χ-scaling (CTM environment)

Fix D and vary χ to check CTM convergence:
```python
D = 3
for chi in [10, 20, 40, 60]:
    config = iPEPSConfig(
        max_bond_dim=D,
        ctm=CTMConfig(chi=chi, max_iter=80),
        gs_num_steps=200,
        gs_learning_rate=1e-3,
    )
    A, env, E = optimize_gs_ad(gate, None, config)
    print(f"χ={chi}: E/site = {E:.8f}")
```

## Reference Values

| Model | iPEPS D=2 | iPEPS D→∞ (extrap.) | QMC/exact |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| 2D Heisenberg | ≈ −0.6548 | ≈ −0.6694 | −0.6694 |
| J1-J2 at J2/J1=0.5 | model-dependent | — | Debated |

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Energy much too high | D or χ too small | Increase both |
| AD optimization diverges | Learning rate too high | Reduce `gs_learning_rate` |
| CTM not converging | χ too small or max_iter too low | Increase both |
| Wrong symmetry breaking | Wrong unit cell | Try "2site" for AFM order |
| NaN in gradients | SVD degeneracy | Reduce learning rate, check gate is Hermitian |

## Pedagogical Notes

- Connect to solid state: iPEPS is a variational wavefunction for the
  thermodynamic limit, like a Jastrow wavefunction but structured as a
  tensor network.
- The CTM is the 2D analog of the left/right environments in DMRG — it
  summarizes the infinite 2D surroundings of a local patch.
- Excitation spectra from iPEPS are the tensor-network analog of spin-wave
  theory, but non-perturbative.
