# TRG/HOTRG Workflow — Classical Stat Mech with Tenax

This skill guides students through tensor renormalization group calculations
for 2D classical lattice models. TRG is a real-space RG method that
systematically coarse-grains the partition function using tensor decompositions.

## Background for Students

The partition function of a 2D classical model can be written as a tensor
network: one tensor per lattice site, with shared indices representing the
Boltzmann weights of neighboring interactions. The free energy per site is:

    f = -(1/β) lim_{N→∞} (1/N) ln Z

TRG computes this by iteratively contracting and truncating the tensor network,
doubling the effective system size with each step.

## Stage 1: Build the Initial Tensor

### 2D Ising model

Tenax provides a built-in function:

```python
from tenax.algorithms.trg import compute_ising_tensor
import jax.numpy as jnp

beta = 0.44  # Inverse temperature (near T_c ≈ 2.269, β_c ≈ 0.4407)
T = compute_ising_tensor(beta)
print(T.shape)  # (2, 2, 2, 2) — one index per lattice direction
```

The tensor `T` encodes the Boltzmann weights exp(βJ σ_i σ_j) for all spin
configurations on the four bonds meeting at a site.

### Custom models

For models beyond Ising, build the tensor from the Boltzmann weights manually.
The general recipe:

1. Write the energy as a sum over bonds: E = Σ_{⟨ij⟩} ε(σ_i, σ_j)
2. For each site, form a tensor T[u,r,d,l] = Π_{bonds} √(W(σ_bond)) where
   W(σ_i, σ_j) = exp(-β ε(σ_i, σ_j)) and the square root is split between
   the two sites sharing each bond.
3. For the Ising model with σ = ±1:
   W = [[exp(βJ), exp(-βJ)], [exp(-βJ), exp(βJ)]]
   and T is constructed by SVD of W.

### Physics checkpoint

Ask: "What temperature range are you interested in? Is the model exactly
solvable (for validation)? What's the expected critical temperature?"

For the 2D Ising model: T_c = 2/ln(1+√2) ≈ 2.269, β_c ≈ 0.4407.

---

## Stage 2: Run TRG

```python
from tenax.algorithms.trg import trg, TRGConfig

config = TRGConfig(
    max_bond_dim=16,   # Truncation bond dimension χ
    num_steps=20,      # Number of coarse-graining steps
)
free_energy = trg(T, config)
print(f"Free energy per site: {free_energy:.8f}")
```

### What happens at each step

Each TRG step:
1. Decomposes the 4-index tensor T into pairs of 3-index tensors (via SVD).
2. Contracts neighboring pairs to form a new effective tensor T'.
3. Truncates to bond dimension χ.
4. The effective system size doubles: after n steps, the network represents
   2^n × 2^n sites.

After 20 steps: 2^20 ≈ 10^6 sites — effectively the thermodynamic limit.

### HOTRG (Higher-Order TRG)

HOTRG improves upon TRG by using a higher-order SVD (Tucker decomposition)
for the coarse-graining step. This preserves more information and gives
better accuracy at the same χ.

```python
from tenax import hotrg, HOTRGConfig  # HOTRG is a separate module

config = HOTRGConfig(max_bond_dim=16, num_steps=20)
free_energy = hotrg(T, config)
```

---

## Stage 3: Study the Phase Transition

### Temperature scan

```python
import numpy as np

betas = np.linspace(0.3, 0.6, 50)
free_energies = []
config = TRGConfig(max_bond_dim=24, num_steps=20)

for beta in betas:
    T = compute_ising_tensor(beta)
    f = trg(T, config)
    free_energies.append(float(f))

# Plot f(β) — look for the non-analyticity at β_c
```

### Identifying T_c

The free energy itself is continuous at T_c (2D Ising is a second-order
transition), but its second derivative (specific heat) diverges.

```python
# Numerical second derivative
f = np.array(free_energies)
d2f = np.gradient(np.gradient(f, betas), betas)
# The peak of |d²f/dβ²| locates T_c
```

### Specific heat

C = -β² ∂²f/∂β² (per site). The 2D Ising model has a logarithmic divergence:
C ∼ -ln|T - T_c|.

### Magnetization (order parameter)

To extract the magnetization, insert a modified tensor with a spin-weighted
trace. This is more involved — guide students through the impurity tensor
technique if they need it.

## Stage 4: Convergence Studies

### Bond dimension convergence

```python
beta = 0.4407  # At criticality — hardest case
for chi in [4, 8, 16, 32, 64]:
    config = TRGConfig(max_bond_dim=chi, num_steps=20)
    T = compute_ising_tensor(beta)
    f = trg(T, config)
    print(f"χ = {chi:3d}: f = {f:.10f}")
```

Away from T_c, even χ=4 gives good results. At T_c, large χ is needed because
correlations are long-range and the truncation error is largest.

### TRG vs HOTRG comparison

```python
for chi in [8, 16, 32]:
    T = compute_ising_tensor(0.4407)
    f_trg = float(trg(T, TRGConfig(max_bond_dim=chi, num_steps=20)))
    f_hotrg = float(hotrg(T, HOTRGConfig(max_bond_dim=chi, num_steps=20)))
    print(f"χ={chi}: TRG={f_trg:.10f}, HOTRG={f_hotrg:.10f}")
```

HOTRG should be more accurate at the same χ, especially near criticality.

### Exact result for validation

The exact free energy of the 2D Ising model (Onsager):

    f_exact(β) = -kT [ln(2) + (1/2π²) ∫∫ ln(cosh²(2βJ) - sinh(2βJ)(cos θ₁ + cos θ₂)) dθ₁ dθ₂]

At β_c: f ≈ -2.1009 (per site, J=1). Students should compare their TRG result.

Tenax provides a built-in exact solution for validation:

```python
from tenax import ising_free_energy_exact

f_exact = ising_free_energy_exact(beta=0.4407)
print(f"Exact free energy: {f_exact:.10f}")
```

## Stage 5: Beyond the Ising Model

### Potts models (q states)

Build a q×q Boltzmann weight matrix and decompose into a 4-index tensor.
Z_q symmetry can be exploited.

### Clock models

Similar to Potts but with continuous-like angular variables discretized to
q orientations. Shows Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions for q ≥ 5.

### Classical dimer models

The tensor encodes the constraint that each site is covered by exactly one dimer.

## Common Pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Free energy wrong far from T_c | Too few RG steps | Increase `num_steps` |
| Free energy wrong near T_c | χ too small | Increase `max_bond_dim` |
| NaN or Inf in free energy | Overflow in exp(βJ) at large β | Use log-space arithmetic |
| Specific heat peak at wrong T | Finite-χ shift | Increase χ and extrapolate |

## Pedagogical Notes

- TRG is the tensor network realization of Kadanoff's block-spin RG idea.
  Each step is literally a block-spin transformation.
- The bond dimension χ plays the role of the number of kept states — analogous
  to χ in DMRG but for 2D classical systems.
- Connect to the course: the 2D classical Ising model is equivalent (via
  transfer matrix) to the 1D quantum Ising model. TRG on the classical side
  ↔ DMRG on the quantum side.
