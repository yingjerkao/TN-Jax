"""Tensor index (leg) metadata with labels and charge information.

Each leg of a tensor is described by a TensorIndex, which carries:
- The symmetry group governing charges on this leg
- The charge of each basis state along this leg
- The flow direction (incoming/outgoing)
- A label (string or integer) for identification and label-based contraction

Labels are the primary user-facing API for specifying contractions.
Two legs with the same label on different tensors will be automatically
contracted when contract() or TensorNetwork.contract() is called.
